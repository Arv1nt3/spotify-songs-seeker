### Here are the libraries that I've used to make it possible!

* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for api requests
* [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for redux structure
* [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) for connect react with redux
* [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for define the app routes
* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for async actions with redux
* [spotify-sdk](https://github.com/loverajoel/spotify-sdk) for connect spotify with our app written in react js
